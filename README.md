## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

---

### What I Learned

This project helped me refine my **responsive design skills**. I also learned how to structure a profile card efficiently while ensuring **accessibility and semantic correctness**.

One key aspect I implemented was the hover effect for social links:

```css
a:hover {
    background-color: #C4F82A;
    color: #333333;
}

### Continued Development

For future projects, I want to:

- Explore **CSS Grid** for more structured layouts.
- Improve **ARIA accessibility** for better screen reader support.
- Implement **dark/light mode toggles** in UI components.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - Helped me refine my approach to handling different screen sizes.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A great reference for aligning elements properly.
